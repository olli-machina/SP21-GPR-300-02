#version 450

// ****TO-DO?:
//	-> *declare view-space varyings from vertex shader
//	-> declare MRT for pertinent surface data (incoming attribute info)
//		(hint: at least normal and texcoord are needed)
//	-> declare uniform samplers (at least normal map)
//	-> calculate final normal
//	-> output pertinent surface data
