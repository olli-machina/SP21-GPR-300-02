// ****TO-DO: 
//	-> declare inbound and outbound varyings to pass along vertex data
//		(hint: inbound matches TCS naming and is still an array)
//		(hint: outbound matches GS/FS naming and is singular)
//	-> copy varying data from input to output
//	-> displace surface along normal using height map, project result
//		(hint: start by testing a "pass-thru" shader that only copies 
//		gl_Position from the previous stage to get the hang of it)
